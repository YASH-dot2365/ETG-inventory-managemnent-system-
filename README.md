create the records in dictonary upto 30 records with 5 attributes in it
using the import jason convert it in the json file 
now to perform operation again on that json file :

first we have to convert the striing format of records into the dictonary again and hence we use json.loads(name of dictonary)
the to add new records we can use input functions to get the input from users
to purchse the product get input from user and then by multiplying the the quantity and the cost of product we can give him the billing amount
also update the quantity of product in records file

after we update this dictornary
we have have to make update in json so write json.dumps(name of dictonary )from dictonary to string
